Azure gives stronger and faster PaaS capabilities which nowadays is more important part of Cloud infrastructure.

AWS 
-launched in 2001

- 77availability zones 

-public cloud market share 40%

Services
compute-EC2,EBS

storage-s3,s3 glancier,EFS

Azure
- cloud computing service created by microsoft
- used for creating,deploying,testing and managing application and service through a microsoft data center

- launched in 2010

- low latency and provide high availability that needs coustomer requirements
- 54 regions

- 30% of public cloud market share

clients-hp,honeywell,apple,polycom,jonsonh control etc

services
- Virtual machine
- SQL database
- Azure Cosmos DB
- blob storage
-Active directory -Active directory-(AD) as like IAM in AWS
whenever i create account on azure by using my gmail like snehalhingane1998@gmail.com so they create AD like snehalhingane1998gmail.onmicrosoft.com

pricing model

AWS 
- 2cpu +8GB RAM -0.0928 USD/hr
largest instance offered by AWS - 256 RAM + 64 vCPUs having cost arround 3.20 dollar/hr

Azure
-2 vCPUs +8 GB RAM- 0.096 USD/hr
largest instance offered by Azure - 256 RAM + 64 vCPUs having cost arround 6.76 dollar/hr

IOPS 
- IOPS are a unit of measure( input/output operations per second.)
- depends on the volume capacity,
- If have only 1 GB, you can only do 3 Input/Output per second. If you have 100 GB, you can expect 300 IOPS.

Disk 
- for persistent storage data
- Premium SSD - default
- Standard SSD - low cost
- Standard HDD - low cost than standard SSD- but it take more time

Network Security in Cloud Computing
-isolation bwteen multiple zones using services like VPC in AWS and virtual network in azure

AWS
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.inbound and outbound traffic

Azure instance creation
we can connect the VM thorugh the remote desktop connection so onces you paste your public Ip address you will get access to that VM

Azure

Active directory-(AD) as like IAM in AWS

Ansible
-it isconfigration tool that contains the module so the module are the script that used to perform the operation or task on host machine

-inventory file-name of the host
- .cfg file (/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg)-the permissions/previllages to the user
- main file -playbook has modules that perform the operation 

modules
-service	name:

-debug - fro print the statement 

- copy - copying the files 

- creating new directory:
	 - name:
	   file:
	   path: /etc/some_directory
	   state:directory/present
	   mode: '0755'

-git module	- git:
		  repo: path of your git repository

- yum module-	yum:
